# LCOM Metrics Computation
The repository provides the following.
- Implementation of existing five existing variants of LCOM metric (LCOM1, LCOM2, LCOM3, LCOM4, and LCOM5) algorithms as well as a new algorithm (YALCOM). (```src/lcom/metrics/algorithms```)
- Source code of all the cases used to test/establish the ground truth (```tests/LCOMTestSubject/src/lcom/testsubject```)

Start with ```LCOM.java``` file (located in ```src/lcom``` folder). You may run the program by executing ```LCOM.java``` file with two parameters ```-i``` and ```-o``` for input source code folder path and output folder path respectively.
